# A command line utility for working with salesforce.com Tooling & Metadata API

Primary goal of tooling-force.com is to provide the means of interacting with
force.com Medatata API and Tooling API from various command line tools and editor plugins like [vim-force.com](https://github.com/neowit/vim-force.com).


## DESCRIPTION                                             

Current version of this tool is similar in functionality to [Force.com Migration Tool](http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Force.com_Migration_Tool) with one important difference - it is designed with scripting languages (shell, .bat, etc) in mind. All operations can be done by constructing appropriate command line, no messing with XML is required. Results are returned in easy to parse formats.

## FEATURES

### Non project specific:  

- Retrieve - metadata retrieval
- Deploy (all, specific files)
- Run Tests (and report code coverage)
- Describe Metadata - load full metadata description (result is provided in JSON format)
- List Metadata - list members of specific metadata type (e.g. list all Apex Classes)
- ExecuteAnonymous - run arbitrary piece of Apex Code
- ListConflicts - display list of local files which have been updated in SFDC since last deployment
- Execute SOQL query

### Project specific  
Also supported a "project like" mode - where relevant metadata about deployments and retrievals is cached in a set of local files and makes possible operations like:

- Deploy modified files
- List Modified files
- Conflict checking before deployment (test if file(s) you are trying to deploy have been modified by someone else in SFDC since your last Refresh or Deployment.
- list candidates for [Apex](http://youtu.be/u-6JQNuWRdE) and [SOQL](http://youtu.be/rzqgXV3Gx0s) auto-completion (note: current version is "work in progress")
- find definition (go-to-symbol) in apex classes


## System requirements

[Java](http://java.com/download) JDK/JRE, Version 8 or greater

## Installation

Download lastest .jar file from [releases page](https://github.com/neowit/tooling-force.com/releases).
Assuming .jar file name is `tooling-force.com-0.1.jar` you can run it like so: 

    java -jar tooling-force.com-0.1.jar
    
This will display main help and list of supported commands/actions. In order to get help for specific command run it like so:  

    java -jar tooling-force.com-0.1.jar --help=<action-name>


### Proxy
When connection requires proxy it can be passed as java -D params or as tooling-force.com.jar command line params, e.g. 
 
	java -jar tooling-force.com-0.1.jar --action=refresh ... --http.proxyHost=localhost --http.proxyPort=8888 --http.proxyUser=some --http.proxyPassword=pass

## Building tooling-force.com

 - make sure you have [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) installed.
 - make sure you have [Antlr4](http://www.antlr.org) installed.
 - scala version: 2.11
 
 ```    
 git clone git@github.com:neowit/tooling-force.com.git 
 ```
 
 - Generate partner-api, apex-api, metadata-api and tooling-api jars using instructions from [Force.com Web Service Connector (WSC)](https://github.com/forcedotcom/wsc)
 - rename and place generated files under lib folder such as the file structure looks like this (assuming API v32.0)
<pre>
	lib/
	----apex-wsdl-32.0.jar
	----partner-wsdl-32.0.jar
	----metadata-wsdl-32.0.jar
	----tooling-wsdl-32.0.jar
	----force-wsc-32.0.0.jar
	----<a href="http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-runtime-4.4.jar">antlr-runtime-4.4.jar</a>
	project/
	src/
	assembly.sbt
	build.sbt
</pre>


 - make sure line `test in assembly := {}` in `assembly.sbt` is *not* commented out. If it is then tests will run and your build will fail (this is due to some tests dependent on a specific structure of the Org against which tests are run)

```
	cd tooling-force.com/src/main/java
	antlr4 -o ./com/neowit/apex/parser/antlr Apexcode.g4
	antlr4 -o ./com/neowit/apex/parser/antlr Soql.g4
	cd ../../../
    sbt assembly
```
Note - the end result will be .jar file which does NOT contain scala runtime. In order to run that jar you will need to either run it from you IDE (with scala runtime specified) or use scala directly, e.g.:  
```
$ scala tooling-force.com-assembly-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
